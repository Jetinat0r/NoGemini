# NoGemini
![No Gemini Icon](NoGeminiIcon.png "No Gemini")

A Chrome extension that removes Google Gemini's invasive and often incorrect search results.

No Gemini accomplishes this by adding "&udm=14" to every search made, which tells Google to use "Web" mode.

This does mean that Google Images and the like do not function if the extension is active, but the extension can be easily toggled on and off in its popup menu.
